
# Expense Tracking System Using Python 3.7 and Pyqt5

This is a Personal Project i initially am creating for 
Tracking my own Purchases that i make on a daily basis for My Business.

My Motivation Behind creating this Project is to no longer have the hassel of writing down my Purchases in 
my Phone's "Notes" Application.



## Installation

To Run This Project Locally You need to install PyQt5



```bash
  pip install PyQt5
```
